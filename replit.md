# ReiseVeteran - German Travel Planning Application

## Overview
ReiseVeteran is a comprehensive German travel planning web application that empowers users to create, manage, and explore travel experiences with advanced features and intuitive design.

## Current Status
- **Last Updated**: January 18, 2025
- **Status**: In Development - Authentication Issue Resolved

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Local authentication system (Supabase connection replaced)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Recent Changes
- ✓ Fixed syntax error in TripCalendar.tsx component
- ✓ Corrected DOM nesting warning in Footer component
- ✓ Identified Supabase connection issue causing authentication failure
- → Implementing local authentication system to resolve login problems

## Authentication Issue
The current authentication system relies on Supabase (https://ycfbegvjeviovbglbrdy.supabase.co) which is not accessible. This is causing users to be unable to log in.

**Solution**: Implement local authentication using the existing PostgreSQL database and Express backend.

## User Preferences
- Language: German (primary interface language)
- Communication: Simple, non-technical explanations
- Focus: Travel planning functionality with budget tracking and calendar features

## Project Architecture
- Frontend uses React with wouter for routing
- Backend handles API requests and database operations
- Database schema includes users, trips, activities, restaurants, and budget items
- Authentication currently broken due to Supabase connectivity issues

## Next Steps
1. Implement local authentication system
2. Update authentication hooks to use local backend
3. Test login functionality
4. Ensure all existing features continue to work
